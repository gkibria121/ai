## ðŸ”¹ Beginner Projects

1. **Student Marks Analyzer**

   - Use NumPy to generate random marks for 100 students in 5 subjects.
   - Store the data in a Pandas DataFrame with columns like `Math`, `Science`, `English`â€¦
   - Calculate average marks, highest score per subject, and rank students.
   - Plot: bar chart of average scores per subject, histogram of total marks.

2. **Weather Data Simulation**

   - Generate synthetic daily temperature & rainfall data for 1 year using NumPy.
   - Put it into a Pandas DataFrame (`Date`, `Temperature`, `Rainfall`).
   - Find hottest/coldest day, average rainfall, rolling 7-day temperature mean.
   - Plot: line chart for temperature trend, scatter plot for rainfall vs. temperature.

3. **FIFA Player Stats (mini Kaggle project)**

   - Use a dataset like [FIFA players stats](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset).
   - Load into Pandas, clean columns (convert wages like "â‚¬200K" into numbers using NumPy).
   - Analyze top 10 players by Overall, find distribution of player positions.
   - Plot: scatter plot of `Overall vs. Potential`, pie chart of positions.

4. **Stock Market Visualizer**

   - Get sample stock data (from Yahoo Finance CSV).
   - Use Pandas to compute moving averages (7-day, 30-day).
   - Use NumPy for percent change, daily returns, cumulative returns.
   - Plot: closing price + moving averages, histogram of daily returns.

5. **COVID-19 Data Tracker**

   - Download a COVID-19 dataset (cases, deaths, recovered).
   - Clean it using Pandas (handle missing values, filter by country).
   - Use NumPy to calculate growth rates and doubling time.
   - Plot: line plot of cases over time, bar plot of top 10 affected countries.

6. **Movie Ratings Dashboard**

   - Use [IMDB/MovieLens dataset](https://grouplens.org/datasets/movielens/).
   - Pandas: group by genre, calculate average rating, most-rated movies.
   - NumPy: create rating distributions, normalize rating scales if needed.
   - Plot: bar chart of avg ratings by genre, scatter plot of rating vs. number of reviews.
